    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cheesecake is a dessert made with a soft fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese, quark or ricotta), eggs, and sugar.</p>
    <p>It may have a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake. Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked, and is usually refrigerated.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package strawberry-flavored gelatin (such as Jell-OÂ®)</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1 package cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve strawberry gelatin in boiling water in a bowl; cool in refrigerator until thick, but not set, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Beat evaporated milk in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until whipped and thick. Gradually pour strawberry gelatin mixture into evaporated milk, beating constantly. Fold cream cheese mixture into gelatin-milk mixture to form cheesecake filling.</li>
        <li>Set graham cracker crust on a baking sheet or plate to maintain stability. Pour cheesecake filling into crust. Refrigerate until cake is set, at least 3 1/2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
